Kanda IV, adhyaya 6, brahmana 4
This is Satapatha Brahmana IV.6.4 English translation of the Sanskrit text, including a glossary of technical terms. This book defines instructions on Vedic rituals and explains the legends behind them. The four Vedas are the highest authortity of the Hindu lifestyle revolving around four castes (viz., Brahmana, Ksatriya, Vaishya and Shudra). Satapatha (also, Śatapatha, shatapatha) translates to “hundred paths”. This page contains the text of the 4th brahmana of kanda IV, adhyaya 6.
1. Then as to the Mahāvratīya (graha)[1]. Now when Prajāpati had created the living beings, his joints were relaxed: with his relaxed joints he was unable to raise himself. Then the gods went on praising and toiling. They saw this Mahāvratīya (cup) and drew it for him: thereby they restored his joints.
2. With his joints thus restored, he approached this food, what food of Prajāpati there is,--for what eating is to men, that the vrata (fast-food, or religious observance generally) is to the gods. And because (they say), 'Great, indeed, is this vrata whereby he has raised himself,' therefore it is called Mahāvratīya.
3. Now, even as Prajāpati then was, when he had created the living beings, so are those who sit (in sacrificial session) for a year; and as Prajāpati then, after a year, approached food, so do they now, after a year, approach food, for whomsoever that knows this, they draw that cup.
4. Let him draw it for Indra Vimṛdh (the Averter of scorn), for, verily, the scorners of those who sit for a year are smitten, and all is won by them: hence for Indra Vimṛdh,--with (Vāj. S. VIII, 44; Rig-veda X, 152, 4), 'Scatter thou our scorners, O Indra, lay them low that war against us, and send them, that persecute us, to the nethermost darkness!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Vimṛdh!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Vimṛdh!'
5. Or for Viśvakarman (the All-worker), for all work is done, everything is won by those who sit in session for a year: hence for Viśvakarman,--with (Vāj. S. VIII, 45; Rig-veda X, 81, 7), 'Vācaspati Viśvakarman, the thought-speeder[2], let us invoke for protection in our struggle[3] this day: may he, the all-beneficient worker of good, delight in all our offerings[4] for our protection!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Viśvakarman[5]!--This is thy womb; thee to Indra Viśvakarman!'
6. But if he knows the (verse) referring to Indra (and) Viśvakarman, let him draw it thus[6] (Vāj. S. VIII, 46), 'O Viśvakarman, with strengthening libation madest thou Indra an invincible champion: to him did the people bow down of old, because[7] he, the mighty, is worthy of adoration.--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Viśvakarman!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Viśvakarman!'
