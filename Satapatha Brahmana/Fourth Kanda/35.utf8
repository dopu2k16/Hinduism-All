Kanda IV, adhyaya 6, brahmana 5
This is Satapatha Brahmana IV.6.5 English translation of the Sanskrit text, including a glossary of technical terms. This book defines instructions on Vedic rituals and explains the legends behind them. The four Vedas are the highest authortity of the Hindu lifestyle revolving around four castes (viz., Brahmana, Ksatriya, Vaishya and Shudra). Satapatha (also, Śatapatha, shatapatha) translates to “hundred paths”. This page contains the text of the 5th brahmana of kanda IV, adhyaya 6.
1. Now the graha[1], forsooth, is he that burns yonder, since by him all these creatures are held (swayed). Hence they say, 'We take (grab) the grahas,' 'They walk, seized by the grahas.'
2. The graha, forsooth, is Vāc (speech); for by speech everything is swayed (grab) here[2],--what wonder, then[3], that Vāc is the graha?
3. The graha, forsooth, is the name, for everything is held (fixed) by a name here,--what wonder, then, that the name is the graha? We know the names of many, and are they not thereby held by us[4]?
4. The graha, forsooth, is food; for by food everything is kept (grah) here: hence as many as eat our food, all those are kept by us. Such is the natural order of things.
5. And as to this graha of Soma, that is food; for whatever deity one draws this graha, that deity, being seized by this graha, fulfils that wish of his for which he draws it. He approaches either the rising or the setting sun, thinking, 'Thou art the seizer, seize thou N.N. by such and such a disease! may N.N. not obtain such and such!' (naming) him whom he hates; or with, 'May such and such a wish not be fulfilled to him!' and, assuredly, that wish is not fulfilled to him for whom he thus approaches (the sun).
