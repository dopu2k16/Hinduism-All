1. Verily, they who sit (sacrificing) for a year, by means of six months go to him that burns yonder:
so it is told on the part of the Sāman, in as much as it is made of the form of that (sun) it is told on the part of the Ṛk[2]; and now in like manner on the part of the Yajus, by means of preparatory rite, when they draw that (graha)[3], they thereby also go to him (the sun).
2. He thus takes it therefrom with (Vāj. S. VIII, 41; Rig-veda I, 50, 1)[4], 'The lights bear on high that divine knower of beings, Sūrya, that all may see him!--Thou art drawn with a support: thee to Sūrya nor splendour!--This is thy womb: thee to Sūrya for splendour!'
