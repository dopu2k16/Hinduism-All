1. Verily, from out of faith the gods fashioned the initiation, from out of Aditi the opening (sacrifice[1]), from out of Soma the buying (of Soma-plants), from out of Viṣṇu the guest-offering, from out of the sun the Pravargya, from out of the Svadhā (the food of departed ancestors) the Upasads, from out of Agni and Soma the day of fasting, and from out of this world the opening Atirātra[2].
2. From out of the year (they fashioned) the Caturviṃśa day, from out of the priesthood the Abhiplava (ṣaḍaha), from out of the nobility the Pṛṣṭhya (ṣaḍaha)[3], from out of Agni the Abhijit, from out of the waters the Svarasāman days, from out of the sun the Vishuvat,--the Svarasāman days have been told;--from out of Indra the Viśvajit,--the Pṛṣṭhya and Abhiplava have been told;--from out of Mitra and Varuṇa the Go and
Āyus[4], from out of the Viśve Devāḥ the Daśarātra[5], from out of the regions the Pṛṣṭhya-ṣaḍaha of the Daśarātra, from out of these worlds the Chandoma days.
3. From out of the year (they fashioned) the tenth day, from out of Prajāpati the Mahāvrata, and from out of the world of heaven the Udayanīya Atirātra:--such was the birth of the Year; and, verily, whosoever thus knows that birth of the Year becomes more (and more) glorious to (the end of) it, he becomes possessed of a (new) body, he becomes the Year, and, as the Year[6], he goes to the gods.
