Kanda XIII, adhyaya 2, brahmana 3
This is Satapatha Brahmana XIII.2.3 English translation of the Sanskrit text, including a glossary of technical terms. This book defines instructions on Vedic rituals and explains the legends behind them. The four Vedas are the highest authortity of the Hindu lifestyle revolving around four castes (viz., Brahmana, Ksatriya, Vaishya and Shudra). Satapatha (also, Śatapatha, shatapatha) translates to “hundred paths”. This page contains the text of the 3rd brahmana of kanda XIII, adhyaya 2.
1. Now, the gods did not know the Pavamāna[1] at the Aśvamedha to be the heavenly world, but the horse knew it. When, at the Aśvamedha, they glide along[2] with the horse for the Pavamāna (-stotra), it is for getting to know (the way to) the heavenly world; and they hold on to the horse's tail, in order to reach the heavenly world; for man does not rightly know (the way to) the heavenly world, but the horse does rightly know it
2. Were the Udgātṛ to chant the Udgītha[3], it would be even as if one who does not know the country were to lead by another (than the right) way. But if, setting aside the Udgātṛ, he chooses the horse for (performing) the Udgītha, it is just as when one who knows the country leads on the right way: the horse leads the Sacrificer rightly to the heavenly world. It makes 'Hiṅ[4],' and thereby makes the. Sāman itself to be 'hiṅ': this is the Udgītha. They pen up mares, (and on seeing the horse) they utter a shrill sound: as when the chanters sing, such like is this. The priests’ fee is gold weighing a hundred (grains): the mystic import of this has been explained[5].
