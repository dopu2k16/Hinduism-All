Kanda XIII, adhyaya 2, brahmana 10
This is Satapatha Brahmana XIII.2.10 English translation of the Sanskrit text, including a glossary of technical terms. This book defines instructions on Vedic rituals and explains the legends behind them. The four Vedas are the highest authortity of the Hindu lifestyle revolving around four castes (viz., Brahmana, Ksatriya, Vaishya and Shudra). Satapatha (also, Śatapatha, shatapatha) translates to “hundred paths”. This page contains the text of the 10th brahmana of kanda XIII, adhyaya 2.
1. When they prepare the knife-paths, the Sacrificer makes for himself that passage across, a bridge, for the attainment of the heavenly world.
2. They prepare them by means of needles; the needles, doubtless, are the people[1] (clans), and the Aśvamedha is the royal power: they thus supply him with people and royal power combined. They are made of gold: the meaning of this has been explained.
3. Three kinds of needles are (used), copper ones, silver ones, and gold ones;--those of copper, doubtless, are the (principal) regions (of the compass), those of silver the intermediate ones, and those of gold the upper ones: it is by means of these (regions) they render it fit and proper. By way of horizontal and vertical (stitches[2]) they are many-formed, whence the regions are many-formed; and they are of distinct form, whence the regions are of distinct form.
