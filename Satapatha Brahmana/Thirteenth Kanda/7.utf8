THE INITIATION OF THE SACRIFICER.
1. Prajāpati desired, 'Might I perform a horse-sacrifice[1]?' He toiled and practised fervid devotion. From the body of him, when wearied and heated, the deities departed in a sevenfold way: therefrom the Dīkṣā (initiation) was produced. He perceived those Vaiśvadeva[2] (oblations). He offered them, and by means of them he gained the Dīkṣā: and when the Sacrificer offers the Vaiśvadeva (oblations) it is the Dīkṣā he thereby gains. Day after day he offers them: day after day he thus gains the Dīkṣā[3]. Seven of them he offers; for seven were those deities that departed (from Prajāpati); it is by means of them that he (the priest) gains the Dīkṣā for him.
2. But, indeed, the vital airs depart from those who exceed (the duration of) the Dīkṣā. For seven days they observe it; for there are seven (outlets of) vital airs in the head, and the Dīkṣā is the vital airs: it is by means of the vital airs he gains the Dīkṣā, the vital airs, for him. He makes offering by dividing (each) deity into three parts[4]; for the gods are of three orders[5], and of three orders are these worlds: he thus establishes himself in these worlds in prosperity and vital power.
3. They amount to one and twenty (single invocations and oblations),--there are twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun as the twenty-first,--that is the divine ruling-power, that is the glory: that supreme lordship, that summit of the fallow one (the Sun), that realm of light he attains.
4. Thirty Audgrabhaṇas[6] he offers,--of thirty syllables the Virāj (metre) consists, and the Virāj means all food: thus (he offers) for the obtainment of all food. Four Audgrabhaṇas he offers (on each day), and three Vaiśvadevas;--they amount to seven; for there are seven vital airs of the head, and the Dīkṣā is the vital airs: by means of the vital airs he thus gains the Dīkṣā, the vital airs, for him. A full (-spoon)-oblation[7] he offers last for the sake of invigoration and union.
