1. Prajāpati's eye swelled; it fell out: thence the horse was produced; and inasmuch as it swelled (aśvayat), that is the origin and nature of the horse (aśva). By means of the Aśvamedha the gods restored it to its place; and verily he who performs the Aśvamedha makes Prajāpati complete, and he (himself) becomes complete; and this, indeed, is the atonement for everything, the remedy for everything. Thereby the gods redeem all sin, yea, even the slaying of a Brahman[1] they thereby redeem; and he who performs the Aśvamedha redeems all sin, he redeems the slaying of a Brahman.
2. It was the left eye of Prajāpati that swelled: hence they cut off the (meat) portions from the left.
side of the horse, and from the right side of other victims.
3. There is a rattan mat, for the horse was produced from the womb of the waters, and the rattan springs from the water: he thus brings it in connection with its own (maternal) womb.
4. The Catuṣṭoma[2] is the form of chanting (on the first day); for a bee tore out[3] (a piece of) the horse's thigh, and by means of the Katuṣṭoma form of chanting the gods restored it: thus when there is the Katuṣṭoma mode of chanting, it is for the completeness of the horse. The last day is an Atirātra with all the Stomas[4]--with a view to his obtaining and securing everything, for an Atirātra with all the Stomas is everything, and the Aśvamedha is everything.
