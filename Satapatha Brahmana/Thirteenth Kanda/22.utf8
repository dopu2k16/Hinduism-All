Kanda XIII, adhyaya 3, brahmana 2
This is Satapatha Brahmana XIII.3.2 English translation of the Sanskrit text, including a glossary of technical terms. This book defines instructions on Vedic rituals and explains the legends behind them. The four Vedas are the highest authortity of the Hindu lifestyle revolving around four castes (viz., Brahmana, Ksatriya, Vaishya and Shudra). Satapatha (also, Śatapatha, shatapatha) translates to “hundred paths”. This page contains the text of the 2nd brahmana of kanda XIII, adhyaya 3.
1. Now this (Sacrificer), having- conquered by means of the supreme Stoma--the Katuṣṭoma, the Kṛta among dice[1],--on the next day establishes himself on the Ekaviṃśa[2], as a firm foundation: from the Ekaviṃśa, as a firm foundation, he subsequently ascends to the next day, the seasons; for the Pṛṣṭha (-stotras) are the seasons, and the seasons are the year: it is in the seasons, in the year, he establishes himself.
2. The Śakvarī[3] (verses) are the Pṛṣṭha (-stotra of the second day): there is a different metre for each (verse), for different kinds of animals, both domestic and wild ones, are immolated here on each (day). As to the Śakvarī (verses) being the Pṛṣṭha, it is for the completeness of the horse (sacrifice)[4]; and different kinds of animals are immolated on different (days), because different stomas are performed on the different (days of the Aśvamedha).
3. As to this they say, 'These--to wit, goats and sheep and the wild (beasts)--are not all animals[5]; but those--to wit, the bovine (victims)--are indeed all animals.' On the last day he immolates bovine (victims), for they--to wit, bovine (victims)--are all animals: he thus immolates all animals. They are sacred to the All-gods[6], for the completeness of the horse, for the horse is sacred to the All-gods. They are many-formed (or, many-coloured), whence animals are many-formed; and they are of distinct forms (or colours), whence animals are of distinct forms.
