1. Verily, the horse is slaughtered for all the deities: were he to make it one belonging to Prajāpati (exclusively), he would deprive the deities who are co-sharers of their share. Having made ghee (to take the part of) portions (of the horse's body) he makes oblations[1] to the deities in mentioning them one by one with (Vāj. S. XXV, 1-9), 'The Grass (I gratify) with the teeth, the Lotus with the roots of the hair, . . . :' the deities who are co-sharers he thus supplies with their share. When he has offered the Araṇyeऽnūcya (oblations)[2], he offers the last oblation to
Heaven and Earth; for all the gods are established in heaven and on earth: it is them he thereby gratifies. Now the gods and the Asuras were contending together.
2. They (the gods) spake, 'We are the Agnayaḥ Sviṣṭakṛtaḥ[3] of the horse (sacrifice); let us take out for ourselves a special share: therewith we shall overcome the Asuras.' They took the blood for themselves in order to overcome their rivals; when he offers the blood to the Sviṣṭakṛts, it is in order to overcome (his own) rivals; and the spiteful rival of him who knows this is undone by himself.
3. The first oblation (of blood) he offers[4] in the throat (gullet) of the Gomṛga[5]; for Gomṛgas are cattle, and the Sviṣṭakṛt is Rudra: he thus shields the cattle from Rudra, whence Rudra does not prowl after the cattle where this oblation is offered at the Aśvamedha.
4. The second oblation[6] he offers on a horse-hoof; for the one-hoofed (animals) are cattle, and the Sviṣṭakṛt is Rudra: he thus shields the cattle from Rudra, whence Rudra does not prowl after the cattle where this oblation is offered at the Aśvamedha.
5. The third oblation he offers in an iron bowl; for the people (subjects) are of iron[7], and the Sviṣṭakṛt is Rudra: he thus shields the people from Rudra, whence Rudra does not prowl after the cattle where this oblation is offered at the Aśvamedha.
