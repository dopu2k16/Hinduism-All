1. Now the doctrines of mystic imports[1]. The Śākāyanins hold that 'Agni is Vāyu (the wind);' but some say that 'Agni is Āditya (the sun).' And either Śraumatya, or Hāliṅgava, said, 'Agni is no other than Vāyu: wherefore the Adhvaryu, when he performs the last work[2], passes into that (wind).'
2. And Śāṭyāyani said, 'Agni is no other than the Year; his head is the spring, his right wing the summer, his left wing the rainy season, his middle body (trunk) the autumn season, and his tail and feet the winter and dewy seasons--Agni is speech, Vāyu breath, the sun the eye, the moon the mind, the quarters the ear, the generative power water[3], the feet (and tail) fervour, the joints the months, the veins the half-moons, the silver and gold feathers the days and nights: thus he passes over to the gods.' Let him know, then, that Agni is the Year; and let him know that it is thereof[4] he consists.
3. And Celaka Śāṇḍilyāyana said, 'Let him know that the three layers containing the naturally-perforated (bricks)[5] are these worlds, that the fourth (layer) is the Sacrificer, and the fifth all objects of desire; and that it is these worlds, and his own self and all his objects of desire he compasses.'
