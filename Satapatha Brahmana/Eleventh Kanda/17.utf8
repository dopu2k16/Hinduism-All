Satapatha (also, Śatapatha, shatapatha) translates to “hundred paths”. This page contains the text of the 2nd brahmana of kanda XI, adhyaya 3.
1. Verily, whosoever knows the six pairs in the Agnihotra, has offspring born to him by pair after pair, by all generations. The Sacrificer and his wife--this is one pair: through it his Agnihotra would be possessed of a wife,--'May I obtain this pair!' he thinks[1]. The calf and the Agnihotra-cow--this is another pair: through it his Agnihotra-cow would become possessed of a male calf,--'May I obtain this pair!' he thinks. The pot and the coals--this is another pair; the offering-spoon and the dipping-spoon--this is another pair; the Āhavanīya fire and the log--this is another pair; the libation and the Svāhā-call--this is another pair: these, doubtless, are the six pairs in the Agnihotra; and he who thus knows them, has offspring born to him by pair after pair, by all generations.
