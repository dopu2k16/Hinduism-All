Satapatha (also, Śatapatha, shatapatha) translates to “hundred paths”. This page contains the text of the 1st brahmana of kanda XI, adhyaya 8.
1. Verily, even as this cart-wheel, or a potter's wheel, would creak[1] if not steadied, so, indeed, were these worlds unfirm and unsteadied.
2. Prajāpati then bethought him, 'How may these worlds become firm and steadied?' By means of the mountains and rivers he stablished this (earth), by means of the birds and sun-motes[2] the air, and by means of the clouds and stars the sky.
3. He then exclaimed, 'Wealth!'--now, wealth[3] (mahas) means cattle, whence they (cattle) thrive (mahīyante[4]) exceedingly in the homestead of one who possesses many of them; and this (Sacrificer), indeed, possesses many of them, and in his homestead they do thrive exceedingly. Wherefore, if people were either to forcibly drive him from his home, or to bid him go forth, let him, after performing the Agni-hotra, approach (the fires) saying, 'Wealth'; and he becomes firmly established by offspring and cattle, and is not deprived of his home.
